		 programming model in which a network of steps
		 (functions) communicate through message-passing as well
		 as a limited form of shared memory. This paper
		 describes a new implementation of CnC for Haskell.
		 Compared to existing parallel programming models for
		 Haskell, CnC occupies a useful point in the design
		 space: pure and deterministic like Evaluation
		 Strategies, but more explicit about granularity and the
		 structure of the parallel computation, which affords
		 the programmer greater control over parallel
		 performance. We present results on 4, 8, and 32-core
		 machines demonstrating parallel speedups over 20x on
		 non-trivial benchmarks.",
