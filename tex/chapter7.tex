% TODO discussion: bring up fact of running callbacks twice does not
% affect result

% Discuss the addition of quiescence in order to actually use the result of the
% computation. Also discuss the efficiency of our system. In order to make it
% usable we need to replace the threshold checks with some callback that spawns
% the required callbacks. This of course is also required to not depend on any
% shared mutable state.
% Discuss threshold reads: Could introduce a get stmt. Draw some
% conclusions of the problematic nature of deterministic concurrency and that
% great care has to be taken when trying to prove determinism for so called
% "deterministic-by-design" systems.
